# Toast Catalog App

The **ToastCatalog App** is a simple Android application I developed in Kotlin. It showcases a variety of functionalities and features, including API connections, data management, UI customization, navigation between activities, and Android tests.

## Features

### API Connections
The app demonstrates how to connect to a web API using Retrofit and fetch a list of items. It handles both successful and unsuccessful API responses.

### Data Management
It showcases the ability to save and load data from internal storage. The app saves the fetched items to a JSON file and loads them when there is no internet connection.

### Connection Management
The app checks the network connection status and displays a message when offline. It also attempts to refresh the data when an internet connection is available.

### UI Customization
Customization features include changing the color of the menu and implementing a splash screen that appears on app launch.

### Navigation Between Activities
The app allows users to navigate between the main activity, where items are displayed, and the item detail activity, where item-specific details are shown.

### Android Tests
The project includes both positive and negative Android tests using Espresso.
